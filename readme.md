# Insights about the airline delays. Analyzed using groovy programming language and MongoDB.



## Exercise 1: Planning 
Choose a JSON dataset that is of your interest.  

Define a query that will require at least one of each of the following type of operations (SQL statements included for reference only as we are working with NoSQL technology):

data selection (typical SELECT * FROM ... in SQL),
data projection (typical SELECT COL1, COL2, COL3 FROM ... in SQL),
data filtering (typical condition in SELECT * FROM ... WHERE condition),
data combination (like sums) and/or data grouping (like GROUP BY in SQL).
In the presentation, explain the chosen data set (schema, context) and the intented query.

## Exercise 2: programming with Groovy collections 

Implement your query in Groovy, execute it to test its functionality, and elaborate on the Groovy code. The explanation should be self-contained and include an interpretation of the results. Align your task with the objectives set forth in the introduction, particularly in relation to either data evolution, scalability, or consistency.

## Exercise 3: programming with MongoDB 

Implement the cloud-based solution using the MongoDB Java Driver within a Groovy environment. Execute the code to test its efficacy, and provide a self-contained explanation, interpreting the results in the context of your chosen focusâ€”be it data evolution, scalability, or consistency.

## Exercise 4: critical analysis 

Critically compare the standalone and cloud-based solutions with respect to one of the following aspects:

i) Evolution/Maintenance
ii) Scalability
iii) Consistency
Your presentation must articulate clearly defined comparison criteria, which will then be systematically applied to evaluate the two solutions. Refer to the grading rubric for additional details on what is expected. Align your comparison with the specific objectives stated in the introduction, ensuring a comprehensive analysis.

## Exercise 5: In-depth Critical Analysis 

Deepen the analysis initiated in Exercise 4 by providing additional evidence and insights. This can include, but is not limited to:

i) Utilising additional datasets from the same domain to reinforce your points.
ii) Performing performance measurements for quantitative backing.
iii) Extending your research on the topic through consultation of relevant academic literature.
